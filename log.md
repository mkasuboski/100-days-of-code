# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Back Story
**Where I come From**: I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development with an emphasis on Mobile Applications. The mobile applications part is all Android for my experience, but I have worked with C#, C++, JAVA, javascript and SQL, as well as HTML and CSS in school. I have dabbled a little bit in Swift 4, but I have not written any applications with it. I am looking to focus on one language for starters in order to get better. I decided to start with a refresher on web development so I can actually design a website that will help me showcase my skills for potential employers or customers. While I am doing this, I am also contemplating getting an A+ Certification, but I don't know if it would be worth it.

### Day 0 November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have used my 1 hour plus today learning more about github and learning how to format the readme file for the log. I have decided to refresh my HTML skills for starters. The files are:formatting.html and About ME.html.

### Day 1 November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am re-learning CSS. I don't know how anyone actually learns anything in college. everything goes by so quickly, especially when you are going to college full time and working full time. I did not go to college for web design, so I had very little concentration on HTML5 and CSS. I learned what I had to, but I graduated feeling much like the saying goes "jack of all trades, master of none..." I spent much of my time coding today on an external style sheet with css.
### Day 2 November 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my journey with CSS. I have the structure figured out. It is fairly easy to see what the code is doing to the page, but I am still learning/needing to learn. I see colors and shapes and gradients showing real promise toward a great end product but it still looks very rough. I am really enjoying this, but at times it can be a struggle. I spent way more than an hour today...

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
