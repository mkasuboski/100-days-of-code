# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Back Story
**Where I come From**: I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development with an emphasis on Mobile Applications. The mobile applications part is all Android for my experience, but I have worked with C#, C++, JAVA, javascript and SQL, as well as HTML and CSS in school. I have dabbled a little bit in Swift 4, but I have not written any applications with it. I am looking to focus on one language for starters in order to get better. I decided to start with a refresher on web development so I can actually design a website that will help me showcase my skills for potential employers or customers. While I am doing this, I am also contemplating getting an A+ Certification, but I don't know if it would be worth it.

### Day 0 November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have used my 1 hour plus today learning more about github and learning how to format the readme file for the log. I have decided to refresh my HTML skills for starters. The files are:formatting.html and About ME.html.

### Day 1 November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am re-learning CSS. I don't know how anyone actually learns anything in college. everything goes by so quickly, especially when you are going to college full time and working full time. I did not go to college for web design, so I had very little concentration on HTML5 and CSS. I learned what I had to, but I graduated feeling much like the saying goes "jack of all trades, master of none..." I spent much of my time coding today on an external style sheet with css.
### Day 2 November 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my journey with CSS. I have the structure figured out. It is fairly easy to see what the code is doing to the page, but I am still learning/needing to learn. I see colors and shapes and gradients showing real promise toward a great end product but it still looks very rough. I am really enjoying this, but at times it can be a struggle. I spent way more than an hour today...
### Day 0 ***RESTART* April 15th 2020 
It's a new day. Got busy with life and a new job and forgot what was really important! I want to re-commit to the 100 day challenge. I started the free code camp today by going through the entire intro to html.
### Day 1 April 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to refresh on CSS today, spending approximately 2 hours on the lessons. I will continue tomorrow!

### Day 2 April 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**:I spent about two hours and finished the intro to CSS on freecodecamp. I think I finally understand CSS!

### Day 3 April 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'll be honest, not much was learned today except for the fact that sometimes a married man must defer to his wife. I spent a few minutes and started applied design learning, but the rest will have to wait until tomorrow.

### Day 4 April 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with applied design in CSS. Learning much.. Wondering how some people retain all of this. I am starting to think that it will be necessary for me to build a website sometime soon so I can try to apply this knowledge and retain it.

### Day 5 April 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished applied Visual design today. Definitely need to start to build even a mock website. I am gaining too much information to just leave this stuff here, and I will definitely need to set something up that at least partially saves the number of commands that I may not remember otherwise, and applies them to a page that I can reference.

### Day 6 April 21st 2020

**Today's Progress** Started learning applied accessibility on freecodecamp learned how to embed an audio player on a web page.

### Day 7 April 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress** Played around with HTML in a web site. Studied a few different website designs. continued with applied accessibility.
