				<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Mike</strong>. Thanks for visiting my website! I have created this website to showcase some of my work.</p>

				<h3>Where I come From</h3>
				<p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development with an emphasis on Mobile Applications. The mobile applications part is all Android for my experience, but I have worked 
				with C#, C++, JAVA, javascript and SQL, as well as HTML and CSS in school. I have dabbled a little bit in Swift 4, but I have not written any applications with it. 
				I am looking to focus on one language for starters in order to get better. While I am doing this, I am also contemplating getting an A+ Certification, but I don't know if it would be worth it.</p>
				<aside>This website is a work in progress.</aside>
