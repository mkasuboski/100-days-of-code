<p>
Hi, my name is <strong>Mike</strong>. Thanks for visiting my website! I have created this website to showcase some of my work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Where I come From</b>: I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development with an emphasis on Mobile Applications. The mobile applications part is all Android for my experience, but I have worked with C#, C++, JAVA, javascript and SQL, as well as HTML and CSS in school. I have dabbled a little bit in Swift 4, but I have not written any applications with it. I am looking to focus on one language for starters in order to get better. While I am doing this, I am also contemplating getting an A+ Certification, but I don't know if it would be worth it.
